1. Create directories
-----------------------
 mkdir myfirstdirectory
 mkdir testdir{1..10}
 mkdir mydirectory anotherdirectory thirddirectory
 mkdir -p parentdir/childdir{01..100}
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain how Linux goes about formatting the directory layout of the following Linux command: 1. mkdir -p parentdir/childdir{01..100}

2. Move between directories
---------------------------
 cd parentdir
 pwd
 cd ..
 cd parentdir/childdir023
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain the role of the / separator when it comes to navigating through directories within a filesystem on Linux
 cd ../..

3. Move between directories part 2
----------------------------------
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Within a Linux filesystem you are in the /root directory. The following Linux commands are executed in this order: 1. mkdir root, 2. cd root, 3. pwd, 4. cd .., 5. cd /root, and 6. pwd. What is the difference between the terminal output of the Linux commands pwd in step 3 and step 6. In addition, what is the cause of this difference?
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain the very top-level root directory (/) within a Linux filesystem
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain how every file, folder, device, configuration, user data, etc, within a Linux system is stored within the very top-level root directory (/)
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain the root user's home directory (/root) within a Linux filesystem
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain how the following Linux command is leveraging an absolute path when it comes to changing the directory from /home/user2/dir1 to /var/log/nginx: 1. cd /var/log/nginx
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain how the following Linux command is leveraging a relative path when it comes to changing the directory from /home/user2/dir1 to /var/log/nginx: 1. cd ../../../var/log/nginx
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain the similarities, differences, pros, and cons of using a relative path versus an absolute path when accessing directories within a Linux filesystem
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain the root user within a Linux filesystem
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain the root user being under the directory /root while other users have their respective directory under /home (all within a Linux filesystem)
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain the similarities, differences, pros, and cons of accessing the directory for the root user (/root) using the following Linux commands: 1. cd /root and 2. cd root

4. Come back home!
------------------
 cd $HOME
 echo $HOME
 cd ~
 cd
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain the overall efficiency of changing the current working directory in a Linux filesystem, /var/log, to the $HOME directory, /root, via the following group of Linux commands listed under scenarios 1 thru 4
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - Explain the similarities, differences, pros, and cons of the following Linux commands: 1. cd $HOME, 2. echo $HOME, 3. cd ~, and 4. cd

5. Delete directories
---------------------
 rmdir root
 rmdir testdir{1..10}
 rmdir parentdir
 rmdir -p parentdir
 rmdir parentdir/*
 rmdir -p parentdir/childdir
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the following Linux commands throwing an error in the terminal, for a Linux filesystem, due to the child directory of parentdir, childdir, containing contents: 1. rmdir parentdir, 2. rmdir -p parentdir, 3. rmdir parentdir/*, and 4. rmdir -p parentdir/childdir
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of every entity within a Linux filesystem being a file
 rm parentdir.txt
 (AI PROMOT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of why the following Linux command will throw an error: 1. rm parentdir
 rm -rf parentdir
 rm -rf /
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the similarities, differences, pros, and cons of the following Linux commands: 1. rm parentdir.txt, 2. rm -rf parentdir, and 3. rm -rf /
