1. Copy files
-----------------------
 tree sourcedir

 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the recursive nature of the following Linux command: 1. tree sourcedir

 cp [OPTIONS] SOURCE DESTINATION
 cp one ../targetdir
 cp one ../targetdir/another-one
 cp [OPTIONS] SOURCE_FILE1 SOURCE_FILE2 ... DESTINATION_DIRECTORY
 cp two01 two02 ../targetdir
 man 7 glob

 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the following wildcard within the shell of a Linux system: 1. ?
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the following wildcard within the shell of a Linux system: 1. * START HERE

 ls -l three*
 ls -l three* | wc -l
 cp three0? ../targetdir
 ls -l ../targetdir/three*
 ls -l ../targetdir/three* | wc -l

 cp -R sourcedir anotherdir

 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the behavior of the following Linux command when the directory (anotherdir) doesn't exist versus when it does exist: 1. cp -R sourcedir anotherdir

2. Move files
-----------------------
 mv sourcedir/one movedfiles/

 mv anotherdir/one movedfiles/another-one

 mv sourcedir/two01 sourcedir/two02 movedfiles/

 mv anotherdir/ newdir/

 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of how the directory structure of movedfiles/ will look like after the execution of the following Linux command: 1. mv newdir/ movedfiles/   NOTE: Prior to the execution of the Linux command mv newdir/ movedfiles/, the directory anotherdir/ was moved into newdir/ via the following Linux command: 1. mv anotherdir/ newdir/

3. More possibilities
-----------------------
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of how the following Linux command can be leveraged to copy the content from the file .profile to the file newfilewithcontent.txt: 1. cat .profile > newfilewithcontent.txt   NOTE: The file newfilewithcontent.txt doesn't exist prior to the execution of the Linux command cat .profile > newfilewithcontent.txt
