1. The use of pipes and first pipe
----------------------------------
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of a pipe in Linux

 grep
 grep 'case' .bashrc
 wc
 wc -l .bashrc
 sort
 sort numbers.txt
 uniq
 |
 cat numbers.txt
 cat numbers.txt | wc -l
 cat numbers.txt | uniq | wc -l
 cat numbers.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l

 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the significance of the relationship between uniq (Linux command) and sort (Linux command) via the output of the following Linux commands: 1. cat numbers.txt | uniq | wc -l and 2. cat numbers.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l, Additional Notes: numbers.txt is a file that contains 10,000 records of numeric values (whole numbers) between 1-100
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the significance of sort (Linux command) preceding uniq (Linux command) via the output of the following Linux command: 1. cat numbers.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l, Additional Notes: numbers.txt is a file that contains 10,000 records of numeric values (whole numbers) between 1-100

2. Redirect files 
-----------------
 >
 ls -al > directorylist.txt

 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the output from the following Linux command that is executed after the Linux command, ls -al > directorylist.txt: 1. cat directorylist.txt
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the content within directorylist.txt (from the command ls -al > directorylist.txt) being overwritten because of the execution of the subsequent Linux command: 1. cat .profile > directorylist.txt

 >>

 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the following Linux command in the scenario that directorylist.txt does not exist within the relative path of the current directory because it was removed earlier (via the Linux command, rm directorylist.txt): 1. cat .profile > directorylist.txt
 echo 'this line is a separator!' >> directorylist.txt

 ls -al >> directorylist.txt

 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the stdout that is redirected into directorylist.txt via the given sequence of Linux commands within the following groups: Group 1 - 1. ls -al > directorylist.txt, 2. cat .profile > directorylist.txt, 3. cat directorylist.txt AND Group 2 - 1. cat .profile > directorylist.txt, 2. echo 'this line is a separator!' >> directorylist.txt, 3. ls -al >> directorylist.txt, 4. cat directorylist.txt
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the similarities, differences, pros, and cons of the following redirection operators within Linux: 1. > AND 2. >>

3. Input redirection
--------------------
 wc -l numbers.txt | awk '{print $1}'
 awk 'END{print NR}' numbers.txt
 <
 wc -l < numbers.txt
 wc -l < numbers.txt > count.txt
 sort < numbers.txt | uniq
 (AI PROMPT THIS) - In the context of the SDLC within an enterprise environment, provide a detailed explanation of the following Linux command: 1. while read line; do echo "Content of the line: ${line}"; done < numbers.txt, Additional Notes: numbers.txt is a file that contains 10,000 records of numeric values (whole numbers) between 1-100
